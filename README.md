## Questions

**Question 1:** A rabbit which can be dragged around the screen. Moving the rabbit on one tab moves it to the same position on the other tab. Essentially, the rabbit's position is universal for all users of the app.

**Question 2:** TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript. It also provides type inference similar to that provided by languages like Haskell.

**Question 3:** Bundlers allow us to conveniently manage all of our dependencies on a per-project basis and share those dependencies across a development team. Parcel automatically detects language extensions used in a project (TypeScript, CSS, etc.) and installs them for us. It also comes bundled with a develoment server with hot-reloading.

**Question 4:** A

**Question 5:** A
